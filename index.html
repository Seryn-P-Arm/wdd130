            <p>
                Hi there. I'm Seryn.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love ice cream, jelly beans and drawing, listening to music, coding, writing, 
                eating, and cooking. I live in South Africa, Cape Town but come from Krugersdorp in 
                Gauteng, and moved to a town called Hopefield in the Western Cape before moving to
                Cape Town finally.<br/>
                I went to a great Afrikaans school for my last 6 years of school. I took Engineering
                Graphics and Design, Eng HL, Afr FAL, Mathematics, Business Studies, Computer
                Applications Technology and Life Orientation. I did well and achieved high grades
                that got me Full Colors and even a Bursary from a popular honey retailer in 
                town called Simplee Bee who paid my final year of school fees.<br/>
                I work in a company called Lanline Technologies, which is situated in Cape Town 
                and I currently work as Quality Control for the Development Team I am in. I test 
                their websites and apps they have and make sure everything is according to standard and
                expectations. I love the company though I have only been there for over 4 months now.
                They are a great company, close-knitted like family with wonderful connections. 
                They are heading to become top ISP in their local area.

                national animal), elephant, zebras, leopards, buffalos, hippos, cheetahs, giraffes,
